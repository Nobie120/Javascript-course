## Code Explanation
const decrease, reset, increase: These constants hold references to the HTML buttons.
const countlable: Holds a reference to the HTML element displaying the count.
let count = 0: Initializes the count variable with an initial value of 0.
The button click events are handled using the onclick property, and the count value is updated accordingly. The updated count is then reflected in the HTML content.
```
javascript
Copy code
increase.onclick = () => {
    count++;
    countlable.textContent = count;
}

decrease.onclick = () => {
    count--;
    countlable.textContent = count;
}

reset.onclick = () => {
    countlable.textContent = 0;
}
```
